# About

Inspired by [Cybergordon](https://cybergordon.com/) and [IntelOwl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl).

This project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to check the reputation of your observables using multiple services, 
without having to deploy a **complex** solution.

![cyberbro_gh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d82a021c-a199-4f07-ab26-7af8e1b650a0)

# Features

* **Effortless Input Handling**: Paste raw logs, IoCs, or fanged IoCs, and let our regex parser do the rest.
* **Multi-Service Reputation Checks**: Verify observables (IP, hash, domain, URL, Chrome extension IDs) across multiple services like OpenCTI, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, IPInfo, Spur.us, MDE, Google Safe Browsing, Shodan, Abusix, Phishtank, ThreatFox, URLscan, Github, Google...
* **Detailed Reports**: Generate comprehensive reports with advanced search and filter options.
* **High Performance**: Leverage multithreading for faster processing.
* **Automated Observable Pivoting**: Automatically pivot on domains, URL and IP addresses using reverse DNS and RDAP.
* **Accurate Domain Info**: Retrieve precise domain information from ICANN RDAP (next generation whois).
* **Abuse Contact Lookup**: Accurately find abuse contacts for IPs, URLs, and domains.
* **Export Options**: Export results to CSV and **autofiltered well formatted** Excel files.
* **MDE Integration**: Check if observables are flagged on your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) tenant.
* **OpenCTI Integration**: Get stats (number of incidents, indicators) from OpenCTI and the latest Indicator if available.
* **Proxy Support**: Use a proxy if required.
* **Data Storage**: Store results in a SQLite database.
* **Grep.App**: Search for observables with Grep.App API (fast GitHub searches).
* **Analysis History**: Maintain a history of analyses with easy retrieval and search functionality.

# What Cyberbro does that others don't

* **Accessible to everyone** from beginners to experts. No gatekeeping here.
* **Chrome extensions IDs lookup**: Retrieve the name of Chrome extensions from ID, and get CTI data about it.
* **Lightweight & Easy Deployment**: Simple to set up and use.
* **Advanced TLD Verification**: Uses `tldextract` to accurately extract root domains, helping RDAP lookups.
* **Pragmatic Information Gathering**: Utilizes GitHub and Google indexed results to catch what other engines might miss.
* **CTI Report Integration**: Leverages IoC.One for IoC-related **CTI reports** in HTML or PDF.
* **EDR Integration**: Integrates with solutions like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to check if observables were seen in YOUR environment.


# Getting Started - TL;DR

> [!TIP]
> If you are lazy, you need Docker. \
> Do a `git clone` ; copy `secrets-sample.json` to `secrets.json` ; `docker compose up` then go to `localhost:5000`. Yep, that's it!

# Getting Started

* To get started, clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanfrbd/cyberbro
cd cyberbro
```

## Edit the config file (mandatory)

```
cp secrets-sample.json secrets.json
```

> [!NOTE]
> Don't have API keys? No problem, just copy the `secrets-sample.json` to `secrets.json` and leave all like this. Be careful if a proxy is used. \
> You will be able to use **all free engines!**

* Fill values (including proxy if needed) in the `secrets.json` file.

```json
{
    "virustotal": "token_here",
    "abuseipdb": "token_here",
    "ipinfo": "token_here",
    "google_safe_browsing": "token_here",
    "proxy_url": "",
    "mde_tenant_id": "tenant_here",
    "mde_client_id": "client_id_here",
    "mde_client_secret": "client_secret_here",
    "shodan": "token_here",
    "opencti_api_key": "token_here",
    "opencti_url": "https://demo.opencti.io"
}
```

* Obtain API keys from the official documentation of each service.
* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) is a paid service and can be skipped if you don't have an account (unchecked by default).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can modify the configuration via the GUI at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/config](http://127.0.0.1:5000/config). \
> This endpoint is disabled by default for security reasons, as it is not protected. \
> To enable it, set `app.config['CONFIG_PAGE_ENABLED'] = True` at the beginning of `app.py`. \
> **This is not recommended for public or team use, as it exposes your API keys.**

# Launch the app

## Lazy and easy - use docker

```bash
docker compose up # use -d to run in background and use --build to rebuild the image
```

* Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 and Enjoy.

> Don't forget to edit the `secrets.json` before building the image.

## The old way

* Clone the repository and install the requirements.

You might want to create a [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) before installing the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run the app with `gunicorn` (clean mode).

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -t 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

* Run the app with in development mode.

```bash
python3 app.py
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This is still a development server, not intended for production. \
Some misconfigurations may lead to **security issues**.

# Cyberbro API

* The API is available at `/api/` and can be accessed via the GUI or command-line.

**There are currently 3 endpoints:**

* `/api/analyze` - Analyze a text and return analysis ID (JSON).
* `/api/is_analysis_complete/<analysis_id>` - Check if the analysis is complete (JSON).
* `/api/results/<analysis_id>` - Retrieve the results of a previous analysis (JSON).

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/analyze" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "20minutes.fr", "engines": ["reverse_dns", "rdap"]}'
```

```json

# Special thanks

A huge thank you to all the amazing contributors who made pull requests and helped improve this project:

* [Florian PILLOT](https://github.com/Harukunnn) who reworked engines (refactoring and optimizations).
* [Axel](https://github.com/botlabsDev) who develops [Ioc.One](https://ioc.one/) and added a specific User-Agent allowing scraping of Ioc[.]One.

Your contributions are greatly appreciated!
