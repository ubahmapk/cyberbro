# Project Roadmap

## Philosophy

This project began as a personal initiative and, even as it grows, the goal is to **keep it lightweight**. While there are many opportunities for improvement and new features, simplicity is key (KISS principle). The project is written in Python to encourage contributions from the broader cybersecurity community, even if it’s not the fastest language.

> [!TIP]
> If you are looking for a large-scale, all-in-one solution, consider using [IntelOwl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl) - more complex and resource intensive. It is fully API-based and doesn't really have a results UI. Cyberbro intentionally avoids unnecessary complexity and redundant engines that process the same data. It focuses on providing a simple, efficient tool for cybersecurity professionals, with UX for the results and a simple API for engines.

## Roadmap

### 1. Stability & Reliability
- Improve error handling and logging
- Refactor code for maintainability
- Increase test coverage (unit/integration) - I suck at it...
- Enhance the documentation with examples and use cases - I try my best, but I think it can be better
- Add tutorials (videos, blog posts) for new users - that could be awesome!

### 2. Engine Management
- Add new engines **only if they provide unique value**
- Regularly review and prune redundant or overlapping engines - I really consider removing Google Safebrowsing, as it is not very useful and does not provide data most of the time

### 3. User Experience (UX)
- Enhance CLI/GUI usability
- Improve documentation and onboarding guides
- Provide clear contribution guidelines

### 4. Codebase Enhancements
- Adopt best practices for Python projects
- Modularize code for easier contributions
- Maintain lightweight dependencies

### 5. Community & Contribution
- Encourage open-source contributions
- Foster a welcoming and inclusive environment
- Avoid toxic behavior in discussions
- Credit contributors appropriately - in releases, documentation, and on social media posts.
- Respond to issues and pull requests promptly - that really makes a difference!

## Most Probable Next Steps

- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Selective addition of valuable engines
- Better documentation and examples
- More tests and CI improvements
- Small UX tweaks based on user feedback

---

## Long term Vision
- Maintain a lightweight, efficient tool for cybersecurity professionals
- Focus on quality over quantity in features and engines
- Build a strong, supportive community around the project

**Remember:** The focus is on quality, simplicity, and community—not on becoming the biggest or most feature-rich tool.
