Many questions and issues have already been addressed in the [GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/stanfrbd/cyberbro/issues). Please use the search bar to check if your question has already been answered.

Most API-related questions or errors are due to misconfigurations. Make sure to carefully read the documentation and use the search function. If you find something missing, feel free to open a Pull Request to improve the docs.

## OpenCTI and MISP & every self-hosted instance
For certificate issues, ensure the correct certificate is installed on your machine.  
[Disabling SSL verification](https://docs.cyberbro.net/quick-start/Advanced-options-for-deployment/?h=ssl#ssl-verification-settings-for-requests-backend) is possible but **not recommended**.

## Disabling some engines
If you want to disable certain engines, make sure you set the correct variable as described [here](https://docs.cyberbro.net/quick-start/Advanced-options-for-deployment/?h=engines#selected-engines-in-the-gui-indexhtml-only).

## GitHub Docker Image Errors  
If you encounter errors with the GitHub Docker image, ensure you are authenticated to the GitHub Docker registry. Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token-classic) for guidance.

## Where are the logs?

By default, logs generated by Cyberbro are stored inside the Docker container at `/var/log/cyberbro`, which is mapped to the `logs` directory in the Cyberbro folder on your host machine. However, you can configure the log storage location by adjusting the volume mapping in your Docker configuration.

For example, in your `docker-compose-custom.yml`:

```yaml
services:
    web:
        # ... other configuration ...
        volumes:
            - ./logs:/var/log/cyberbro
```

This configuration ensures that:

- `./logs:/var/log/cyberbro`: Maps the `logs` directory on your host machine to `/var/log/cyberbro` inside the container. You can change `./logs` to any directory you prefer for storing logs.

!!! note
        Persisting logs is useful for troubleshooting and monitoring.  
        Make sure the `logs` directory exists on your host, or Docker will create it automatically.

For more details on volume mappings and other advanced deployment options, see the [Advanced options for deployment](https://docs.cyberbro.net/quick-start/Advanced-options-for-deployment/#example-of-custom-docker-compose-file) documentation.

## Where is the database?

By default, the database used by Cyberbro is stored in the `data` directory inside the Docker container at `/app/data/results.db`, which is mapped to the `data` directory in the Cyberbro folder on your host machine. You can configure the database storage location by changing the volume mapping in your Docker configuration to point to a different directory if needed.

## My API keys seem to be ignored or not stored

!!! danger
    Make sure you use either `secrets.json` or `.env` file for your deployment, not both.  
    This may lead to unexpected behavior as the application will try to read both files and may override some values.
