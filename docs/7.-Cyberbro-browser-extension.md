!!! info
    If you are using a reverse proxy with Cyberbro, ensure that the CORS headers are properly set and that the certificated is trusted on you computer or verified.  
    Without the correct CORS configuration and certificates trust chain (pretty basic, but you can do hardening), the extension will not function correctly.  
    See [the example with Caddy](https://docs.cyberbro.net/Reverse-Proxy-configuration-%E2%80%90-Caddy/).

For localhost:5000 version of Cyberbro (e.g. on your machine with Docker), CORS is already enabled by default in Flask, so no additional configuration is needed.

The extension options include:
- **Cyberbro URL**: The URL of your Cyberbro instance (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:5000` - default). This URL is used to send requests to Cyberbro API.
- api-prefix (optional): The prefix for the Cyberbro API (e.g. `/api` - default). This prefix is used to send requests to Cyberbro API.
- Selected engines: The list of engines that will be used to search for the selected text. You can enable or disable engines by checking or unchecking the checkboxes.

!!! note
    The extension will not work if the Cyberbro instance is not running or the URL is incorrect. The engines will not work if the Cyberbro instance does not have the secrets file properly configured.
